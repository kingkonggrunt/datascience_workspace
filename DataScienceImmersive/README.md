# Data Science Immersive
List of Projects Completed during the Data Science Immersive Course in 2020

- Each Project is a Git Repository and its added into the Data Science Workspace as a Submodule
- Jupyter Notebooks are saved/committed on Git as Markdown `.md` and light script `.py` files using `jupytext`   
  - Using `jupytext`, users can also open `.md` and `.py` files as Jupyter Notebooks. This removes the problem of viewing massive diff changes that come with commiting jupyter notebooks in their native format
  - If users still want to work with a jupyter notebook file `.ipynb` they can regenerate the file with `jupytext --sync <script_name>.py`
